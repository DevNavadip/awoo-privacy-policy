## 1. Information We Collect

We designed Awoo as an **anonymous chat application**. We do **not require account registration** or personally identifiable information to use the core features.

However, we may collect the following types of data:

- **Anonymous Login Data**: We use Firebase Authentication (anonymous or phone-based) to enable secure chat sessions.  
- **Device Information**: Such as device type, operating system, and identifiers (for crash reporting, ads, and analytics).  
- **Advertising Data**: Google AdMob may collect data for personalized and non-personalized ads, depending on user consent.  
- **Chat Data**: Messages are ephemeral and **deleted once the chat session ends**. No permanent history is stored.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

We use collected data for:

- Connecting users in **random one-on-one chats**.  
- Improving app performance and stability.  
- Serving ads (with user consent where required).  
- Preventing fraud, abuse, and misuse of services.  

We **do not sell your data**.

## 3. Data Retention

- Chat messages are **temporary** and automatically deleted when a session ends.  
- Crash logs, analytics, and ad-related data may be retained by third-party services for their operational purposes.  
- No permanent storage of personal chats or user profiles.  

---

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.  

However, we rely on trusted third-party services to operate the app. These services may process data under their own privacy policies:

## 5. User Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- **Access and Delete Data**: Request deletion of any stored data (where applicable).  
- **Opt-Out of Personalized Ads**: Use in-app consent settings or device-level ad settings.  
- **CCPA (California Residents)**: You can opt out of the "sale" of personal information (note: we do not sell your data).  
- **GDPR (EU/EEA Users)**: You can withdraw consent at any time through app settings or the consent dialog.

## 6. Consent Management (UMP & CCPA)

- We use **Googleâ€™s UMP SDK** (User Messaging Platform) to request consent for GDPR and CCPA compliance.  
- Users can choose between **personalized ads, non-personalized ads, or ad-free (where applicable)**.  
- Consent choices can be updated anytime in the appâ€™s settings.

## 7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Our app is intended for **users 18+ only**.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please contact us immediately.
